An interactive speech therapy platform for the Slovak market. It uses OpenAI Whisper for real-time speech recognition and gTTS for audio synthesis to help children practice pronunciation.

The system features a gamified React frontend for audio capture and a FastAPI backend that processes speech blobs and calculates pronunciation accuracy using string similarity algorithms (Levenshtein distance).
